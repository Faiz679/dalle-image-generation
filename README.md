# gptscript-image-generation

This CLI tool is a simple command-line interface for interacting with the OpenAI API. It allows users to input a text prompt and get a response generated by OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. Users can provide the API key directly as a command-line argument or set it as an environment variable before running the script.

## Features

- Accepts an OpenAI API key through the command line or environment variable.
- Accepts a text prompt for text generation and displays the resulting text.
- Supports image generation using a specified model, image size, quality, and the number of images to generate.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key

## How to Build

This CLI tool does not require a build step, as it is a simple Python script. The only requirement is to install the necessary Python dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

You can run this CLI tool using the following command format:

```bash
python cli.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --prompt "Your text prompt here" --model MODEL_NAME --size IMAGE_SIZE --quality IMAGE_QUALITY --number NUMBER_OF_IMAGES
```

### CLI Arguments

- `-k` or `--api-key` (optional): Your OpenAI API key. This can also be set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running the script. If both the environment variable and the command-line option are provided, the command-line option takes precedence.
- `-p` or `--prompt` (required): The text prompt based on which the GPT model will generate a response.
- `-m` or `--model` (optional): The model to use for image generation. Default is "dall-e-3".
- `-s` or `--size` (optional): The size of the image to generate, format WxH (e.g. 1024x1024). Default is 1024x1024.
- `-q` or `--quality` (optional): The quality of the generated image. Default is "standard".
- `-n` or `--number` (optional): The number of images to generate. Default is 1.

### Setting the API Key as an Environment Variable

Instead of passing the API key as a command-line argument every time, you can set it once as an environment variable:

On Unix-like systems, you can set the environment variable like this:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

On Windows, you can set the environment variable like this:

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

After setting the environment variable, you only need to provide the prompt argument when running the tool:

```bash
python cli.py --prompt "Describe a futuristic city."
```

## Examples

### Cartoon lion standing proudly in the savannah
```bash
python cli.py --prompt "Cartoon lion standing proudly in the savannah" --quality "standard"
```

```bash
python cli.py --prompt "A realistic photograph of a squirrel writing some code in a peaceful meadow" --quality "hd"
```
